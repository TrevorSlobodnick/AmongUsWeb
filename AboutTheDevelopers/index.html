                    InnerSloth now has merch! The store currently has limited items,
                    but they have mentioned they would like to release more merch in the future. As of September 2020,
                    they have a great selection of t-shirts as well as a super cute plushie! Currently the
                    store is sold out but that could change at any time, so head to <a href="https://store.innersloth.com">store.innersloth.com</a>
                    and keep refreshing until their items are back in stock!
