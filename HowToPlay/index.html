        <p id="overviewText">
            Before the game starts, you will be assigned a role, either crewmate or impostor.
            The main objective as a crewmate is to finish your tasks or vote off all the 
            impostors. While the impostors main objective is to kill crewmates until the number
            of impostors is the same as the number of crewmates, or the crew doesn't complete a
            sabotage in time. If an impostor kills you, you become a ghost. While your a ghost, you're
            still responsible for finishing your tasks. And don't forget, even if you die you can still win!
